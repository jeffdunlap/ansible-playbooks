# Ansible Playbook Examples

## Description
This playbook is intended to provide useful samples of common system administration tasks in playbooks. In a production playbook, we would make more use of advanced ansible features like roles to promate reusability and do things like make more use of loops, and variables ot make the playbook easier to maintain.

## Dev Container
This repository includes a fedora dev container built for Ansible playbook development. To use the dev container, install Docker Desktop, visual studio code, and the dev-containers VSCode extension. Click the connection icon near the bottom left of VSCode and select open in Container.
